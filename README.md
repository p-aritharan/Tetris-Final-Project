Week 1-3: The first three weeks of the project were spent finalizing our project, coming up with a road map as to how we were going to complete the project, setting up GitHub, and doing research on our project code. Part of our research involved finding sample codes and testing those codes to see if they worked. 

Week 4-6: We spent the fourth through sixth week of the project setting up classes for the game. In this time period we saw ourselves having trouble loading the background and moving our game pieces.  

Week 7: We spent the seventh week of the project adjusting the color to the game pieces in which we encountered a problem of having multi-colored blocks which we solved by making all of the game pieces one color (red). 

In order to play this game, use the 'a' and 'd' keys to move left and right respectively
By pressing the 'w' key you can rotate the block that is generated at the top of the screen
By pressing the 's' key you can speed up the downward movement of the block
Lastly, the spacebar, when pressed, causes the block to travel as far down as it can immediately.

If you have not played tetris before, the goal of the game is to not let the blocks stack all the way up to the top.
If you can get a perfect row of blocks horizontally, then those blocks will dissapear causing the rest of the blocks to move down by 1.

Because our game is not complete, there is no score tally or game over screen
